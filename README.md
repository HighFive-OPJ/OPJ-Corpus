<p>Information about the project so far:</p>
<p>We have collected croatian movie reviews of the newest thriller, sci-fy and horror movies.</p>
<p>We have collected about 3000 sentences and organized them by movie, review and sentence ID.</p>
<p>We have made a pilot annotation campaign with 150 sentences. All of us were annotators in this pilot campaign. We used 0 for positive sentiment, 1 for neutral sentiment and 2 for negative sentiment. After running the code, we got the agreement rate of 0.3182 and this is a Fair agreement.</p>
<p>We have made final two annotation campaigns. In the first round, we made an annotation with 3 annotators and in the final round we made a single annotation for all the sentences.</p>
